# Logic circuits lab in Proteus
A compilation of lab activities in our logic circuits class. 

## Decoder
A decoder is a combinational logic circuit that changes a code into a set of signals. Generally a decoders output code normally has more bits than its input code. The circuit designed here is able to output the square equivalent of the input in 6-bit number, provided that only a 3-bit number (0-7) is inputted.

Design a combinational logic circuit that accepts a 3-bit number and generate a 6-bit binary number output equal to the square of the input number.

## BCD to 7-segment Decoder
A BCD to Seven-segment is a combinational circuit that accepts a decimal point in BCD and generates the appropriate outputs for selection of segments in a display indicator used for displaying the decimal digit. 

Design the BCD to seven-segment decoder utilizing the least number of logic gates.

## Encoder
Encoders are used to translate the decimal values to the binary in order to perform the binary functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. It is the reverse of a Decoder in its function.

Design an encoder circuit that accepts 0-9 decimal switches and can display the equivalent results in a seven segment display. 

### Conditions:
* All segments are OFF if all switches are OFF.
* Provide a switch for lamp test.
* The brightness of the segments can be tested.

### Using:
* Common cathode & a logic low input

## Simple ALU (Addition & Subtraction) 
Design a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit with one selector variable **S** and two input **A** and **B**. When **S=0**, the circuit performs **A+B**. When **S=1**, the circuit performs **A-B** by taking the twoâ€™s complement of **B**. Assume that **A** and **B** to be decimal digit. Use any available package decoder as output converter into a seven segment display. **Unsigned bits only**. 
For this activity, a BCD adder will be used.
